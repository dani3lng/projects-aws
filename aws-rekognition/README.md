### Image Labels Generator

## Services Used
- Amazon S3: For storing the images in the process of generating labels.
- Amazon Rekognition: To analyze images and generate image labels.
- AWS CLI: Interacting with AWS services through the command line interface (CLI).

## Overview of Project
In this project, we will be building an image labels generator, using Amazon Rekognition. This is going to be a fun one. Once built, it will be able to recognize and label images. For example, if you have a photo of a cat, Amazon Recognition will be able to identify what it is, and label the image as a cat.

## Steps to be performed
1. Create an Amazon S3 Bucket
2. Upload images to the S3 Bucket
3. Install/configure the AWS Command line interface (CLI)
4. Import libraries
5. Add detect_labels function
6. Add main function
7. Run python file

## Estimated Time & Cost
- 20-30 minutes
- Cost: Free (When using the AWS Free Tier)
